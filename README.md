## Fancy Feauture
- Our fancy feauture is a post request from a form to the database. It is set to have a feedback type of style to let the company know about the pros/cons/and favourites.
- Our database of choice is atlas.


## Goals and Realities
- We had initial goals to create a e-commerce website with a simple calculator function to add and subtract from the 'cart'. We also wanted a form to use the POST and GET request as a feedback to the database for future pros and cons of the company.
- As time crunched we decided to drop the e-commerce gallery and focus our time on a form that sent infomation to the database and also printed answers to a page.



## Pro's & Cons Of Using A Template
### Pros
- Great design from the start.
- Easy to start a project without having to build all the structure and css.
- It can be a huge time saver in the right situation.
- Budget friendly.

### Cons
- CSS can be very messy and unresponsive.
- Depending how the code is structured there can be alot of over riding issues when implementing your own code & design into a template.
- VERY poor code quality.
- Depending on which template you are using they dont work on all browsers.


## CSS Notes
- skel-noscript.css grid layout / Container / Macro Structure
- style-1000px.css
